// TODO:
// - load and display map of the city/area where the game plays out
// - add player model OR assume first person view with sensible camera position in 3D/PokemonGo style
// - location-based player movement (mock up with input controls too?)
// - get map waypoints/legs/route (Mapbox) and display pawprints in steps
//  * assume fixed static route first, start = train station, mid = bus stop, end = cafe
//  * if tweak parameters are to be added ala Unity Inspector fields, just parse a JSON
// - sync narrative with Toto (how??)
// - display cat in its final position (proximity based) + mock up a win condition/sequence
// - get locations and quest steps from Toto, report back progress to Toto
//  * QR codes? questions? should have here: a nice blend between "gameplay" map and the method to progress, not switching pages
